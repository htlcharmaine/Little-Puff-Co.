# Little-Puff-Co.
Little Puff Co. is a fictional soft‑toy brand created for academic purposes. Drawing inspiration from established toy retailers such as Jellycat, Popmart, and the Disney Store, I designed and developed this website as part of the course CCT360: Web Design and Development II at the University of Toronto.
